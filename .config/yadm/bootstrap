By running the bootstrap you agree:
  * it will install many things that you may not want if you do not modify it
  * any issues it causes are not my fault

Before continuing I highly recommend:
  * look at every file in $BOOTSTRAP_DIR, starting with 'bootstrap' (this script)
  * make sure they do what you want, and modify them (be careful when doing so)
  * if something does not work, run 'yadm reset --hard HEAD' to undo your changes

Bootstrap complete. Next you should modify the dotfiles for yourself

Set the start page using the instructions in the readme
You may also have your own private files on a USB or another device to transfer over
You should also install/configure anything not covered by these dotfiles

If you did not install packages you were prompted with, you can do so later using:
  * the files $BOOTSTRAP_DIR/packages_*.txt
  * 'pikaur -S --needed \$(cat FILE)', where FILE is one of the aforementioned files
