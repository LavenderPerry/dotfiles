By running the bootstrap you agree:
  * it will install many things that you may not want if you do not modify it
  * any issues it causes are not my fault

Before continuing I highly recommend:
  * look at every file in $BOOTSTRAP_DIR, starting with 'bootstrap' (this script)
  * make sure they do what you want, and modify them (be careful when doing so)
  * if something does not work, run 'yadm reset --hard HEAD' to undo your changes
